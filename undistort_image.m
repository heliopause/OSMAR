% as part of undistortion, zero pad image to square (680x680 or 
% largest dim X largest dim should be enough)
%
% possibly make square based on calculated actual center point
% this would be best, so that images for different wavelengths would be 
% centered on the same point, which would make it easier to combine them,
% since would only need to stretch/compress
